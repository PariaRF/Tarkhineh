<p id="description">This is a responsive Single Page Application (SPA) created using vanilla JS and Express. The CSS follows the naming convention of BEM.

 To enhance user experience, the Express package is used to prevent refresh errors on pages other than the home page. By changing the page title, users can determine which page they are currently  in the browser tab. Moreover, users can easily navigate between pages using the browser's back and forward buttons.

You can see the design I used from Figma here:

Within the project. users have the option to add products to their shopping cart. They can increase or decrease the quantity of a product or remove it altogether. All information related to a user's shopping cart is stored in their local storage. Whenever a user returns to the site this information is automatically retrieved. 

On the checkout page users can view their invoice and control it. The costs of each product and the total cost are displayed on this page to increase transparency.</p>
